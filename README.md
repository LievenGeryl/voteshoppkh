1M Coins - 995 - 1 pts - Fine for ironman. Far better alternatives to get them are ingame. It's only a few M per day.

PkHonor points - 4067 - 1 pts - Fine for ironman. Far better alternatives to get them than are ingame. It's only a few PKP per day.

Ex-ex-parrot - 42210 - 500 pts - Fine for ironman. They would still be able to get them from clues. Getting a parrot shouldn't be pure RNG though.

Dark bow (blue) - 43006 - 200 pts + dark bow (11235) - Fine for ironman. No reason why they shouldn't have it in vote shop. Yeah they can get it from clues too. Remove them from clues or leave as is.

Dark bow (green) - 43008 - 200 pts + dark bow (11235) - See above

Dark bow (yellow) - 43010 - 200 pts + dark bow (11235) - See above

Dark bow (white) - 43012 - 200 pts + dark bow (11235) - See above

Brown afro - 43004 - 500pts + Powdered wig (10392) - Fine for ironman. Remove them from clues or leave as is. No reason why there shouldn't be a less RNG-dependent way to obtain them. Still takes a while to save up regardless & this, and the next few items, you still need to do a ton of clues to get the 'ingredients' for them.

Rainbow afro - 12430 - 250pts + Brown afro (43004) - See above.

Black partyhat - 11862 - 1500pts + Red partyhat + Yellow partyhat + Blue partyhat + Green partyhat + Purple partyhat + White partyhat -  See above.

### Items that need some major fixing

Pharaoh's sceptre - 26950 - 500pts - There's so many variants and IDs of the pharaohs sceptre, but at least this one has a wield option. Doesn't work so I can't tell whether or not the model itself is bugged.

Birthday balloons - 21209 - 500pts - The balloons face forward like a sword. They need to face up.

Advanced mystery box - 290 - No one buys this anyways. Very expensive for what it is as well. Also prevents irons from getting godswords, statuses, spiritshields & third age druidic by only voting.

I didn't go with all the skilling sets. The others may be introduced with another update which also gives them their skill bonuses. For now I just took the coolest looking ones. I'd have included graceful, but it's completely broken (every single graceful item looks bugged and either cant be equipped or equips in the weapon slot) and would be a lot of effort for what would be a mininmal-effort but high-impact update.

I didn't include the anger items suggested by Thearlygamer. Many of those custom servers with Pokemons and ak47s have these as over-the-top OP weapons.
